## Biography
### Phase One
#### Volume One
Adam was always a kind but shy child. He was always a favorite of his teachers at school, never caused problems for his parents, and tried to be the best older brother he could be to his kid sister Jordan. But all that changed one night he was selected as the host by Solaris Gamma-Two, a shard of the Universal Concordance. Solaris had been sent to Earth to discover the cause of missing Shards, only to antoher group of aliens that Adam would later call the Blockheads.

While the pair were able to escape the Blockheads, Solaris was damaged by Grand Cataloguer Cracklesnap's energy weapon, causing the Shard to go into a restorative hibernation. While Adam’s parents were keen to put all this behind them, without Solaris to regulate his energy powers Adam needed to regularly burn the energy off or else they would cause unexpected flare ups that were dangerous to anything or anyone around him.

Through the Division, the Amaris were put in touch with the Gale family and their son Harry helped Adam get a hang of his powers.

During the events of the [Halcyon Derby] Adam, now called Concord after a cutoff attempt to explain who the Universal Concordance were, helped the other members of what would become the Menagerie defeat Hannibal Lectric, propelling the newfound group in the local spotlight. Adam’s parents were obviously disappointed in this turn of events.

While Adam was often separated from his new teammates Harry and Jason Quill due to them going to another school (see Gardner Academy), he made fast friends with fellow Halcyon High South student Leo Snow (see Link) who quickly grew very protective of the young Adam. Their friendship often saw the older Leo help Adam with his many fears and anxieties when dealing with new and scary situations.

Late in the first semester of his freshman year in high school, Halcyon High South was overrun by cosmic mercenaries trying to locate something called a World Seed. Concord, Link, and Otto worked together to repeal these mercenaries (including Space Bug), however, it all turned out to be a scheme laid out by Ambra Nerach, a member of the Champions of Night and an enemy of the Concordance. While the Menagerie was able to come together to cause Ambra to flee into a wormhole, it wasn’t until she left Adam with several unsettling questions about who the Universal Concordance were and what they wanted.

In the weeks following the exposure to the World Seed’s energies, Solaris slowly began to reawaken and showed aggression to the other members of the Menagerie. During the Christmas Invasion, while Concord and Mercury had swapped minds due to Ghost Girl’s failed Mind Link spell, Solaris was able to rest control of Adam’s body away from Mercury, defeat the giant Jólakötturinn, and return everyone to their own bodies.

During a training session with the Irregulators and the JHHL, a member of the JHHL, Super Chica, seemed to take interest in Concord but when he tried to talk to her alone, the knowledge that 
Concord shared his mind with an alien intelligence filled her with disgust and caused her to leave. After this, Adam flew around his usual haunts, causing him to discover that construction work at Halcyon High South was instead a cover for a digging operation to unearth the World Seed buried beneath the school. This led to Concord being attacked by the villains Ego Trip and Fractal. Adam called the team for help, but only Link, Pneuma, Otto, and Mercury answered the call. Jason Quill, Ghost Girl, and Summer Skye Newman were unaccounted for.

With help from the Irregulators’ A10, the remaining members of the Menagerie were able to defeat the villains and a group of Tyran Corporation Security Drones, but things quickly turned for the worse as the Azure Empire started the Second Invasion of Halcyon. The Menagerie quickly deduced that the Azure Empire were after the World Seed and theorized that the Tyran Corporation’s targeting of object was spurning this attack. With Link’s assurances that the rest of the team would hold off the Azurite soldiers, Concord teleported to the World Seed to reach it before anyone else could.

Exposure to the World Seed’s energies severely damaged Solaris, much more than the Blockhead weapon had done before. With only moments before Solaris would be destroyed and likely Adam with them, the Shard concocted a plan that might protect Adam: absorb the World Seed and allow Solaris to weave it into Concord’s emotional energy matrix. It would burn out what was left of Solaris but they admitted that they had been permanently damaged during the fight with the Blockheads and it had been a struggle to keep that damage from harming Adam. Replacing the broken parts of Solaris with the World Seed would both protect the World Seed from those who would take the cosmic power source, as well Adam. With great sadness, Adam followed Solaris’ final instructions.

An order of magnitude more powerful than he had already been, Concord helped the Menagerie fend off the Azurite forces until Link and Pneuma forced the retreat of the Azure Empress. After the fighting, Concord teleported to the location of Super Chica, who was helping keep civilians safe at the edge of the battle. While initially still quite angry with Concord from their earlier meeting, after he back into Adam Amari--revealing himself to only be a kid--and telling her about Solaris’ destruction, she grieved with and comforted him as best she could.
